UI tweaks for Firefox to resemble Chromium.
Uses [Firefox-UI-Fix](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix) as a base with icons from [MaterialFox](https://github.com/muckSponge/MaterialFox) and custom CSS rules.

# Installation

1. Go to `about:profiles` and click **Open Directory** in the Root Directory row of the profile you want to edit.
  - *Note: If using the Flatpak version of Firefox, go to `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-name>`, where `<profile-name>` is the last part of the path shown in `about:profiles` for your profile.*
3. Copy `chrome/` and `user.js` from this repo into the directory.
4. Restart your browser.
